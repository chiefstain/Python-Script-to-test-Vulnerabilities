# Python-Script-to-test-Vulnerabilities
Here is an example of a Python script that scans a website for security vulnerabilities using the OWASP ZAP tool:
his script defines a function port_scan() that takes a host name or IP address, a starting port number, and an ending port number as arguments.
It then loops through the range of port numbers specified and attempts to connect to each port using a TCP socket. If the connection is successful, 
it prints a message indicating that the port is open. Finally, it closes the socket.
Note that this is just a simple example of a Python security script, 
and there are many other tools and techniques available for more advanced security testing and analysis.
